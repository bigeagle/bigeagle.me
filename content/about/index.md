I am a research engineer at [Megvii Research](https://research.megvii.com/). 
Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Dept. of CS][DCST], Tsinghua University.
I received my Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering at [NICS lab][DEE], Tsinghua University in 2017,
supervised by Prof. [Huazhong Yang][yanghz] and Prof. [Yu Wang][yuwang]. Before that, I received my
B.S. degree from Xidian University. Check my [google scholar profile][gscholar] for my full publication list.

My current research interest includes Low-level Computer Vision, Image Signal Processing, Computational Photography
and Software-Hardware Co-Design in these applications. Our [solutions on computational photography][SIQPR] has been applied
to various smartphones since 2019.

I am also a supporter of Free/Libre Software. 
I was an experienced user of [Arch Linux][archlinux] since 2009, before I betrayed my beliefs and switched to MacBook in 2021.
I developed many open source projects when I was a student member of [TUNA](https://tuna.moe/) and a maintainer of [TUNA mirror site](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn).
Check my [Github profile][github] for more details of my contributions to the open source community.
